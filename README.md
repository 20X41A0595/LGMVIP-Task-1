# LGMVIP-Task-1 TO-DO LIST
#LETSGROWMORE Task-1 "To Create To-Do List Webapp"

First, I designed the user interface using HTML to structure the web page. I added input fields for tasks and a button to add them to the list and also included an unordered list to display the tasks.

Next, I styled the web app using CSS. Set the background color, font, and layout to create a modern and visually appealing design and added curved corners to the todo list box to give it a polished look.

Then,used JavaScript to add functionality to the web app. Wrote code to handle adding tasks to the list when the "Add" button is clicked. Each task is created as a list item and appended to the unordered list.

Also implemented the ability to delete tasks. Each task item has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the corresponding task from the list. We used JavaScript event handling to achieve this functionality.

Finally,tested the web app in the browser to ensure that tasks can be added and deleted successfully. The todo list web app is now ready to be used to keep track of tasks and manage a to-do list.
